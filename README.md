# EAGLE
Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination in Digital Pathology

## Abstract
>Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed digital pathology by enabling biomarker prediction from high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs). However, current methods are computation-ally inefficient, processing thousands of redundant tiles per WSI and requiring complex ag-gregator models. We introduce EAGLE (Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination), a deep learning framework that emulates pathologists by selectively analyzing informative re-gions. EAGLE incorporates two foundation models: CHIEF for efficient tile selection and Vir-chow2 for extracting high-quality features. Benchmarking was conducted against leading slide- and tile-level foundation models across 31 tasks from four cancer types, spanning morphology, biomarker prediction and prognosis. EAGLE outperformed state-of-the-art foun-dation models by up to 23% and achieved the highest AUROC overall. It processed a slide in 2.27 seconds, reducing computational time by more than 99% compared to existing models. This efficiency enables real-time workflows, allows pathologists to validate all tiles which are used by the model during analysis, and eliminates dependence on high-performance compu-ting, making AI-powered pathology more accessible. By reliably identifying meaningful regions and minimizing artifacts, EAGLE provides robust and interpretable outputs, supporting rapid slide searches, integration into multi-omics pipelines and emerging clinical foundation models.

## EAGLE Feature Extraction

Before extracting EAGLE slide embeddings, please ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. **Extract CTransPath Features at 2 MPP**  
   Use the [STAMP-Benchmark](https://github.com/KatherLab/STAMP-Benchmark) with the following configuration:
   - **Cache Images:** Store in `cache/images`
   - **Tile Features:** Store in `tile_features/2mpp`
   - **Microns:** Set to `448` (with a pixel size of `224`, this results in a 2 MPP magnification)
   - **Normalization:** `false`
   - **Feature Extractor:** `ctp`
   - **Cache:** `true`
   - **Only Feature Extraction:** `false`

2. **Virchow2 Access**  
   - Request access via [Virchow2 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/paige-ai/Virchow2).  
   - Once approved, add your access token to your environment.

3. **CHIEF Model Weights**  
   - Download the CHIEF model weights from the [CHIEF repository](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/CHIEF).  
   - Save the weights to: `models/weights/CHIEF_pretraining.pth`

4. **Prepare the Slide Table**  
   Create a CSV slide table mapping tile features to patient IDs (to account for multiple slides per patient). The CSV must contain the following columns:
   - `PATIENT`: Patient IDs  
   - `FILENAME`: Corresponding `.h5` filename from `tile_features/2mpp`

You can extract the EAGLE slide embeddings using the main extraction script:

```bash
python main_feature_extraction.py
```

or if you want to inspect the selected toptiles:

```bash
python main_feature_extraction.py --visualize
```
